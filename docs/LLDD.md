# Low-Level Design Document (LLDD)

## Overview
This document provides detailed technical specifications and implementation details for the Receipt Settlement PWA, designed with a mobile-first approach.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to provide a responsive and interactive user interface optimized for mobile devices.
- **Static Site**: The application is a static website, functioning entirely on the client-side as a Nostr client.

## User Interface Flow
- **Initial View**: Upon opening the application, the camera is immediately activated to allow users to either scan a QR code or capture a receipt. This ensures that the flow is always initiated by these actions, with a layout optimized for mobile screens.

## Components
### Frontend
- **Receipt Capture**: A component to capture and upload receipt images, activated immediately upon app launch, with a mobile-friendly interface.
- **Receipt Display**: A component to render receipt details from JSON data, designed for easy readability on mobile devices.
- **Payment Interface**: A component to handle payment requests and display QR codes, ensuring usability on smaller screens.
- **Settlement Interface**: A component for settling persons to select items and make payments, with touch-friendly controls.
- **Nostr Event Management**: Handles NOSTR events for publishing and listening to payment and settlement events directly from the client-side, with mobile performance optimizations.

## Data Flow
1. **Receipt Image Upload**: The image is uploaded and processed using client-side integrations with ppq.ai API.
2. **JSON Data Retrieval**: The API returns JSON data, which is validated and used directly on the client.
3. **Event Creation**: A NOSTR kind 9567 event is created with the JSON data and payment request.
4. **QR Code Generation**: A QR code is generated for the event ID.
5. **Settlement Process**: Settling persons scan the QR code, select items, and make payments.
6. **Event Update**: A NOSTR kind 9568 event is published with settled items, updating all users' interfaces.

## Error Handling
- **Image Processing**: Retry mechanism for failed JSON validation (up to 3 attempts).
- **Payment Failures**: Log errors and notify users of payment issues.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure secure data transmission and storage, even without a backend.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Optimize client-side operations for scalability.
